# MinidumpViewer for Windows 10 Mobile (and Desktop)

View raw info from various data streams inside Windows MiniDump format crash dumps. *Very WIP, UI well be different soon*

### Requirements

- Windows 10 Desktop build 16299

   Or
- Windows 10 Mobile build 15254

### Notes
- Uses DbgHelp.MinidumpFiles.UWP and `dbghelp.dll` from Windbg ARM tools (only for W10M)
- Much of the code is essentially a fork of [MinidumpExplorer](https://github.com/GregTheDev/MinidumpExplorer)
